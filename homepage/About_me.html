            <h5>I am a python programmer in Florida that moved from new york and has spent more than 10 years in the state honing and gaining new skills in the field of software development. I'm currently attending a boot camp to get an internship that will likely lead to a job in the business of gaming. I'm currently also in the process of establishing a side project to write music using python to generate a line of music. musically it falls between rock, hardcore, metal, and electronic. I will eventually use that project to launch a full-blown app service using python in the cloud for music purposes.

               The main reason I've chosen python over java/web/etc is because of the speed that it generates results from random factors. in the fast-moving technology market at the current moment, I would rather spend time on my projects than get annoyed that I've been coding. I have been programming in python for over a year now and have written more than 50 small applications and things that make my computer work more efficiently. what I have learned from this process is that python has the amazing ability to automatically find patterns that are in code and it even does so in any random environment with no external help from the programmer. I'm also loving the fast feedback loop and how python gives me more freedom and control over my ideas.hello world
